All files should contain a SPDX short-form identifier to declare under which license they are published.
A SPDX short-form identifier takes the form of:

        SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>

... and is most of the time placed somewhere at the top of a file.
Read more about SPDX short-form identifiers here: <https://spdx.dev/ids/>

A copyright notice in the form of:

        Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holder>

... should also be present near the SPDX short-form identifier if the license is not
the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal. (as in this case a copyright notice wouldn't make sense)


This file ('COPYING.txt') and the 'LICENSE.txt' file are published into the public domain under
Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal.


All files that don't contain a SPDX short-form identifier and don't contain any other sort of
copyright and/or license header are verbatim copies from their original sources.
Copyright belongs to their respectful authors. (this includes all files in the 'LICENSES' directory)
Correct attribution should be found somewhere in these files.


All files inside the 'template' directory (regardless of what is written in the 'template/LICENSE.txt' or
'template/COPYING.txt' files or what the SPDX short-form identifiers are set to in any files inside
the 'template' directory) are published into the public domain under:

        Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (LICENSES/CC0-1.0.txt)

The only exception is the 'template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md' file --- it is a verbatim copy and
the previous paragraph applies. (copyright belongs to the respectful authors)
